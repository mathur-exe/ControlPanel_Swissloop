It could also\noccur if the chip is reset (in which case the VDIG supply remained on) or if it was shut down too\nbriefly to allow the supply time to ramp down. This bit is provided to allow detection of leakage\ncurrent into the supply during shutdown.\nThis bit is checked only set by the device during the device initialization sequence. Once\ncleared, it will not set again until the block is reset."
